As I mentioned in a previous post, one of my goals with Datalaria is to get my hands dirty with projects that allow me to learn and connect different technologies in the data world. Today, we begin a series dedicated to one of those projects: the creation of a **complete global weather service**, from data collection to visualization and prediction, all serverless and using free tools.

In this first installment, we will focus on the **heart of the system: the backend data collector**. We'll see how to build a "robot" that works for us 24/7, connecting to an external API, saving structured information, and doing all this automatically and for free. Let's dive in!

### The First Step: Talking to the OpenWeatherMap API

Every weather service needs a data source. I chose [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) for its popularity and generous free plan. The initial process is straightforward:

1.  **Register**: Create an account on their website.
2.  **Get the API Key**: Generate a unique key that will identify us in each call. It's like our "key" to access their data.
3.  **Store the Key**: **Never** directly in the code! We'll discuss this further below.

With the key in hand (or almost!), I wrote a first `test_clima.py` script to test the connection using Python's fantastic `requests` library:

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" # Temporarily! We'll use Secrets later
CITY = "Madrid"
URL = f"[https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=){CITY}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric&lang=es"

try:
    response = requests.get(URL)
    response.raise_for_status() # Raises an exception for HTTP errors (4xx or 5xx)
    data = response.json()
    print(f"Temperature in {CITY}: {data['main']['temp']}°C")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error connecting to the API: {e}")
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"Unexpected API response, key missing: {e}")
```

**First Obstacle Overcome (with Patience):** When I first ran it, I got a 401 Unauthorized error! 😱 It turns out that OpenWeatherMap API Keys can take a few hours to activate after being generated. The lesson: sometimes, the solution is simply to wait. ⏳

### The "Database": Why CSV and Not SQL?

With data flowing, I needed to store it. I could have set up an SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL...), but that would involve complexity, a server (cost), and for this project, it was overkill.

I opted for radical simplicity: **CSV (Comma Separated Values) files**.

  * **Advantages**: Easy to read and write with Python, perfectly versionable with Git (we can track changes), and sufficient for the initial data volume we'd be handling.
  * **Key Logic**: I needed to append a new row to each city's file daily, but only write the header (`date_time`, `city`, `temperature_c`, etc.) the first time. Python's native `csv` library and `os.path.exists` make this trivial:

```python
import csv
import os
from datetime import datetime

# ... (code to fetch API data for a city) ...

now = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
data_row = [now, city, temperature, ...] # List with the data
header = ['date_time', 'city', 'temperature_c', ...] # List with column names
file_name = f"data/{city}.csv" # We'll create a 'data' folder

# Ensure the 'data' folder exists
os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_name), exist_ok=True)

is_new_file = not os.path.exists(file_name)

try:
    with open(file_name, mode='a', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        if is_new_file:
            writer.writerow(header) # Write header ONLY if new file
        writer.writerow(data_row) # Append the new data row
    print(f"Data saved for {city}")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"Error writing to {file_name}: {e}")
```

### The Automation Robot: GitHub Actions to the Rescue 🤖

Here comes the magic: how to make this script run daily without having a server constantly on? The answer is **GitHub Actions**, the automation engine integrated into GitHub. It's like having a small robot working for us for free.

**Security First: Never Upload Your API Key!**
The biggest mistake would be to upload `registrar_clima.py` with the `API_KEY` written directly in the code. Anyone could see it on GitHub.

  * **Solution**: Use GitHub's **Repository Secrets**.
    1.  Go to `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions` in your GitHub repository.
    2.  Create a new secret named `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` and paste your key there.
    3.  In your Python script, read the key securely using `os.environ.get("OPENWEATHER_API_KEY")`.

**The Robot's Brain: The `.github/workflows/update-weather.yml` File**
This YAML file tells GitHub Actions what to do and when:

```yaml
name: Daily Weather Data Update

on:
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering from GitHub
  push:
    branches: [ main ] # Triggers if changes are pushed to the main branch
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *' # The key: triggers daily at 06:00 UTC

jobs:
  update_data:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use a free Linux virtual machine
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Downloads our code

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.10' # Or your preferred version

      - name: Install necessary dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt # Reads requirements.txt and installs requests, etc.

      - name: Execute data collection script
        run: python registrar_clima.py # Our main script!
        env:
          OPENWEATHER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENWEATHER_API_KEY }} # Securely injects the secret

      - name: Save new data to repository (Commit & Push)
        run: |
          git config user.name 'github-actions[bot]' # Identifies the 'bot'
          git config user.email 'github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com'
          git add data/*.csv # Adds ONLY the modified CSV files in the 'data' folder
          # Check if there are changes before committing to avoid empty commits
          git diff --staged --quiet || git commit -m "Automated weather data update 🤖"
          git push # Pushes changes to the repository
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Automatic token to allow the push
```

**This last step is crucial!** The Action itself acts as a user, performing `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` of the CSV files that the Python script has just modified. This way, the updated data is saved in our repository every day.

### The Serverless Alternative: Deployment and Automation with Netlify 🚀

While GitHub Actions is a fantastic automation tool, for this project I decided to explore an alternative even more integrated with the "serverless" concept: **Netlify**. Netlify not only allows us to deploy our static frontend (like GitHub Pages) but also offers serverless functions and, crucially for our backend, **scheduled functions (or Cron Jobs)**.

#### Deploying the Static Frontend with Netlify

1.  **Connect Your Repository**: The process is incredibly simple. Log in to Netlify, click "Add new site," and select "Import an existing project." Connect with your GitHub account and choose your Weather Service project repository.
2.  **Basic Configuration**: Netlify will automatically detect your project. Ensure that the "Build command" is empty (as it's a static site with no build process) and that the "Publish directory" is the root of your repository (`./`).
3.  **Continuous Deployment**: Netlify will automatically configure continuous deployment. Every time you `git push` to your `main` branch (or whichever branch you've configured), Netlify will rebuild and deploy your site.

#### Automating the Backend with Netlify Functions (and Cron Jobs)

This is where Netlify Serverless Functions shine for our data collector. Instead of a GitHub Actions workflow, we can use a Netlify function to run our Python script on a schedule:

1.  **Project Structure**: Create a `netlify/functions/` folder at the root of your project. Inside, you can have a Python file like `collect_weather.py`.
2.  **Dependency Management**: You'll need a `requirements.txt` file at the root of your project for Netlify to install Python dependencies (`requests`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`).
3.  **`netlify.toml` Configuration**: This file at your project's root is crucial for defining your functions and their schedules:

    ```toml
    [build]
      publish = "." # Directory where your index.html is located
      command = "" # No build command needed for a static site

    [functions]
      directory = "netlify/functions" # Where your functions are located
      node_bundler = "esbuild" # For JS/TS functions. Netlify will detect Python.

    [[edge_functions]] # For scheduling a function (requires Netlify Edge Functions)
      function = "collect_weather" # The name of your function (without the .py extension)
      path = "/.netlify/functions/collect_weather" # The function path (can be different)
      schedule = "@daily" # Or use a cron string like "0 6 * * *"
    ```

4.  **The Python Function (`netlify/functions/collect_weather.py`)**: This function will encapsulate the logic of your `registrar_clima.py`. Netlify will execute it in a Python environment.

    ```python
    # netlify/functions/collect_weather.py
    import json
    import requests
    import os
    import time
    from datetime import datetime
    import csv

    # ... (all your registrar_clima.py script code goes here) ...
    # Ensure API_KEYs are read from os.environ
    # and that data is written directly to the repository using GitPython
    # or in a way that Netlify can persist changes.
    # **Important**: Netlify Functions are ephemeral.
    # To persist changes in the repo, you would need Git integration
    # similar to what GitHub Actions would do (using a Personal Access Token).
    # However, for a static frontend, the simplest approach is for this function
    # to only generate a predictions JSON and upload it to storage like S3,
    # or for the Python collection script to continue running on GitHub Actions
    # and Netlify only serve the frontend.
    # If the idea is for Netlify to ALSO commit, this is more complex
    # and would require a Git API or a PAT token from Netlify.

    def handler(event, context):
        # The main call to your data collection logic would go here
        # This is a simplified example
        try:
            # Your logic to fetch and save data, generate CSVs/JSONs
            # If you want this to commit to GitHub, you would need:
            # 1. A GitHub PAT token stored as an environment variable in Netlify.
            # 2. A library like GitPython to interact with Git.
            # It is more common for serverless functions to persist data in databases
            # or object storage services (e.g., S3), not in the Git repo itself.
            
            # For this project, the GitHub Actions approach for the backend
            # that directly commits to the repo is still simpler
            # for CSV storage. Netlify would be ideal for the frontend
            # and functions for real-time APIs or lightweight predictions.

            print("Netlify function for weather collection executed.")
            # If the function generates any JSON output for the frontend, it would return it here:
            # return {
            #     "statusCode": 200,
            #     "body": json.dumps({"message": "Data collection complete"}),
            # }
            return {
                "statusCode": 200,
                "body": json.dumps({"message": "Backend logic would run here. For data persistence in GitHub, GitHub Actions is more direct."}),
            }
        except Exception as e:
            return {
                "statusCode": 500,
                "body": json.dumps({"error": str(e)}),
            }
    ```

5.  **Environment Variables in Netlify**: For the `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`, go to `Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment variables` and add your key there.

**Important Consideration**: For the Netlify function to persist changes directly to your GitHub repository (like committing the CSVs), you would need a more advanced setup (such as using a GitHub Personal Access Token within the Netlify function to perform `git push`), which is more complex. To maintain simplicity and direct storage in the Git repository with automatic CSV commits, the **GitHub Actions solution remains the most straightforward and efficient for the data collector backend in this specific case**. Netlify excels at frontend deployment and for functions that interact with external services or databases without committing to the main application's Git repository.

In this project, we use GitHub Actions for the backend (collecting and committing CSVs) and Netlify for frontend deployment and potentially for lighter, real-time functions that don't need to modify the Git repo.

---

**This last step is crucial!** The Action itself acts as a user, performing `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` of the CSV files that the Python script has just modified. This way, the updated data is saved in our repository every day.

### The Scaling Problem (and the Necessary Architectural Pivot)

My initial idea was to monitor about 1000 cities and store everything in a single `weather_data.csv` file. I did a quick calculation: 1000 cities \* \~200 bytes/day \* 365 days \* 3 years... over 200 MB! 😱

**Why is this a problem?** Because the frontend (our dashboard, which we'll see in the next post) runs in the user's browser. It would have to download that *entire* 200 MB just to display the graph for *one* city. Totally unacceptable in terms of performance. 🐢

**The Architectural Solution:** Switch to a **"one file per entity"** strategy.

  * We create a `data/` folder.
  * The `registrar_clima.py` script now generates (or appends data to) one CSV file per city: `data/Madrid.csv`, `data/Leon.csv`, `data/Tokyo.csv`, etc.

This way, when the user wants to see the weather for Leon, the frontend will only download the `data/Leon.csv` file, which will be just a few kilobytes. Instant loading! ✨

**Second Scaling Obstacle (API Limits):** OpenWeatherMap, in its free plan, allows about 60 calls per minute. My loop to get data for 155 cities (my current list) would make these calls too quickly.

  * **Vital Solution:** Add `import time` at the beginning of the Python script and `time.sleep(1.1)` at the end of the `for city in cities:` loop. This introduces a pause of slightly more than 1 second between each API call, ensuring we stay below the limit and avoid being blocked. 🚦

-----

### Conclusion (Part 1)

We've got the foundation! We've built a robust and automated system that:

  * Connects to an external API securely.
  * Processes and stores historical data for multiple entities (cities).
  * Runs daily, at no cost, thanks to GitHub Actions.
  * Is designed to scale efficiently.

In the next post, we'll put on our frontend developer hats and build the interactive dashboard that will allow any user to explore this data with dynamic graphs. Don't miss it!
