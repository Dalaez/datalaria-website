Welcome to Datalaria!

This is the very first post, the starting point of a project born from a dual need: professional and personal.

Professionally, I operate in a high-demand industrial and technological environment. I see every day how data and artificial intelligence are ceasing to be abstract concepts and becoming critical tools. This blog is my laboratory to experiment with those tools, to understand them deeply, and hopefully, to apply that knowledge in my career.

Personally, I am naturally curious. This is my public logbook, my commitment to structured learning and sharing the journey. Here I will document my experiments, my mistakes, and my discoveries.

Thank you for joining me at this kilometer 0.
