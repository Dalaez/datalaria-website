## The Engineering Behind Datalaria

**Hi, I'm Daniel. I am a Telecommunications Engineer, but my real work focuses on building bridges between business strategy and technical execution.**

For over 15 years, I have operated in **high-stakes environments (Defense Industry, Multinational R&D)**, learning that technology is useless if it isn't robust, scalable, and above all, useful for business objectives.

Today, I apply that mindset and passion to the world of **Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and Process Automation**.

### Why Datalaria?

Datalaria was born out of frustration and ambition. The frustration of dealing with process inefficiency and unmanageable digital bureaucracy, and the ambition to demonstrate that a single engineer, armed with the right tools (AI, APIs, Cloud), can transform the way we work.

My approach is based on three pillars (**First Principles Thinking**):

1.  **Global Business Vision:** Every post on this blog aims to provide tangible value to business strategy or day-to-day productivity.
2.  **Dogfooding:** Everything I teach here, I use. From [AI Agents](/en/posts/ai_agents_part1/) to data visualization tools.
3.  **Continuous Improvement:** I follow Lord Kelvin's maxim: *“If you cannot define it, you cannot measure it. If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it. If you cannot improve it, it always degrades.”*

### What is Datalaria?

* **Consulting:** I help transform industrial and business processes using AI and Data.
* **Product Development:** I create tools ([Apps](/en/apps/)) and [Games](/en/games/) that test the capabilities of the modern web and real-time latency.
* **Outreach:** I translate technical complexity into actionable strategy through this blog.

If you are looking for someone who speaks the language of business with a passion for technology, you are in the right place.
