Hi everyone!

My name is Daniel, and I'm a telecommunications engineer with over 15 years of experience in R&D and engineering projects within a multinational Defense and Security company.

I'm passionate about any new technology, tool, or system that makes the impossible possible, or simply makes difficult tasks easier.

Recently, I've embarked on a journey into the world of data analysis, guided by Lord Kelvin's maxim: "What is not defined cannot be measured. What is not measured, cannot be improved. What is not improved, is always degraded."

Through the articles on this blog, I aim to deepen my understanding of data and the ever-popular field of AI by connecting them to my daily lifeâ€”activities like sports, children's education, personal organization, and travel. The goal is to experiment as part of a continuous improvement process, while hopefully providing something useful to anyone who lands on this page.

If you've stumbled upon this blog, thank you for your time. I would be delighted to hear any questions, suggestions, or feedback you may have on any of the articles published.
